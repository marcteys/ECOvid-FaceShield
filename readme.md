# ECOvid Protective Face Sheild

A protective face shield fast to print and that use a minimum amount of material. 

The face shield prints in **20 minutes** and uses only **2.35m** of filament.

This face shield is currently used in ICU MIR  at Hospital Cochin (APHP, Paris).  This design is validated by the Hygiene Committee of the hospital.

## Print Settings

The *.curaprofile* is present on this repo, as well as some *.3mf* files. The profile can be imported on `Preferences>Configure Cura>Profiles>Import`. 

Here are the important settings with a 0.4 nozzle. 
- Layer height: *0.38mm*
- Initial layer height: *0.28mm*
- Line width: *0.46mm* 
- Fill gaps between walls: *Nowhere*
- Infill density *80%*
- Print speed: *90 mm/s*
- Initial layer speed: *25 mm/s*
- Generate support: *No*
- Build plate adhesion Type: *Skirt*

**Note:** It is important that there is no holes between the layers and the walls. Adujst your printer settings if you see that there is a hole between two walls: Change the setting *Fill gaps between walls*  to * Everywhere* if it's the case.

## Fabrication

### Material
- A4 transparent sheet 
- Standard EU punch hole, 2 holes ([exemple](https://www.google.com/search?q=punch+hole+2&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk01VRlmL0uM0lpgbsiWLHW1cRw-DiQ:1585672351383&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjr1-_pkcXoAhXU8OAKHVQoCY4Q_AUoAXoECAsQAw))
- 3d printed 

### Steps
- 3D print the face shield 
- Setup your hole puncher to A6 settings
- Punch two holes on one side of the transparent shield, flip it over and punch two more holes from the other side. 
- Attach the transparent sheet
- Sterilize



## Edit the model

The source (*.blend*) is included. It is composed of three separate parts, **External**, **Internal** and **Strap**. I rely on non-destructive modelling techniques and used a lot of boolean operations.

To adjust the height of the stack, select each part and edit the value *count* of the *Array* modifier. 

To export the model, select the 3 parts and click *Export* on the 3D-print panel.

The following add-ons were used: Measure-it, 3D-Print Toolbox,  Bool Tool, Curve Tools and Bezier Utilities. Freestyle for rendering.
